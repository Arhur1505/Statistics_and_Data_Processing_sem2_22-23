# Statistics and Data Processing
This repository contains materials and exercises related to the **Statistics and Data Processing** course, offered in the second semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.

## Course Overview
The course introduces students to fundamental concepts in probability, statistical methods, and data processing techniques, covering:

- Probability theory fundamentals, including probability spaces and distributions.
- Estimation methods: parametric and non-parametric estimation.
- Hypothesis testing and statistical inference.
- Data analysis and preprocessing techniques.
- Stochastic processes and statistical decision-making.
- Computational methods for data processing and visualization.

Laboratory exercises were conducted using statistical and computational tools to apply:

- **Probability distributions and random number generation.**
- **Parametric and non-parametric estimation techniques.**
- **Hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations.**
- **Data processing and exploratory data analysis.**
- **Implementation of statistical methods in real-world applications.**

All programming tasks and exercises were designed to develop hands-on experience in statistical computation and data-driven decision-making.
